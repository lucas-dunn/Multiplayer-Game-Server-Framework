# Multiplayer Game Server Framework

Welcome to the **Multiplayer Game Server Framework**, an easy-to-use server-side platform for building real-time multiplayer games. This framework is designed to handle the complexities of player management, game state synchronization, matchmaking, and more.

## Features

- **Multi-room support**: Efficient management of multiple rooms with unique player sessions.
- **Real-time communication**: WebSockets-based communication for low-latency interactions.
- **Matchmaking system**: Dynamic player matchmaking to ensure the best gameplay experience.
- **Server-side logic**: Powerful features for game logic and room control.
- **Scalable architecture**: Built to scale with your game's growing player base.
- **Cross-platform**: Supports various client libraries, including JavaScript and Unity.

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to set up the server:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucas-dunn/multiplayer-game-server.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd multiplayer-game-server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start on port `2567` by default.

## Usage

### Basic Server Setup

This is how you define and run a simple room:

```javascript
import { Server } from "your-framework";
import { MyGameRoom } from "./rooms/MyGameRoom";

const server = new Server();

server.define("game_room", MyGameRoom);
server.listen(2567, () => {
    console.log("Game server is up and running!");
});
```

### Client Interaction

To connect a client, use the provided WebSocket interface or integrate with your game's client (Unity, Cocos2D, etc.).

```javascript
const client = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:2567");

client.onmessage = (message) => {
    console.log("Received:", message.data);
};
```
